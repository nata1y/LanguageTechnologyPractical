INTRODUCTION:

    The attachment includes two programs: program_file_input.py
    and program_keyboard_input.py. Both programs implement the
    same Question and Answering system, however program_file_input
    reads questions from a file in the specified format and writes
    the answers in another file in the specified format.
    The program_keyboard_input.py program takes input from the
    keyboard, one question at a time, and outputs the answer
    on the screen.

INSTRUCTIONS:

    Run instructions for program_keyboard_input.py:
        In order to run the program from the terminal,
        use the command:
            python3 program_keyboard_input.py
        The program will then wait for a question.
        Insert the question and then press enter.
        Wait for the answer, then you may proceed to
        enter another question or you can exit via CTRL+C
        or CTRL+Z.

    Run instructions for program_file_input.py:
        In order to run the program from the terminal,
        use the command:
            python3 program_file_input.py
        The program will take questions from a text file
        present in the same directory as the program named:
            test_questions.txt
        The format of the questions is expected to be as
        described in the slides of week 5. The program will
        then read the questions from the file and write the
        answers in a text file named:
            answer_questions.txt
        present in the same directory as the program. This file
        is automatically created if it does not already exist in the
        directory. The program terminates automatically after all
        questions have been answered. The program may also be
        terminated while it is running using CTRL+C or CTRL+Z.

NOTES:

    Two files are provided due to the fact that it is not entirely
    clear whether the program should take input from a file or from
    the keyboard, so both options are covered.
